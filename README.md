## Tips
### Dataset Path
The dataset is expected to be located in the `public/data` directory, which is currently an empty folder.

### Page Development
All pages to be developed are located in the `/src/views` folder. Route modifications should be coordinated and will preferably be handled by me to ensure consistency.

### Reusable Components
If you identify components that can be reused across different parts of the application, please factor them out into the `/src/components` directory for maintainability and easier code management.

### Technology Stack
- Vue 3.x
- ElementUI
